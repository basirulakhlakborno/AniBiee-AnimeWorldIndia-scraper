## Security Features

### Origin Blocking

The API implements origin-based access control:

- Requests to `/api/*` endpoints require a valid `Origin` or `Referer` header
- Origins must match the `CORS_ORIGIN` environment variable
- Requests without origin/referer or with non-allowed origins receive a 403 Forbidden response
- Set `CORS_ORIGIN=*` to allow all origins (not recommended for production)

### Rate Limiting

- 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP address
- Applied to all `/api/*` endpoints

### Security Headers

- Helmet.js for security headers
- CORS configuration
- Compression middleware

## Error Handling

- **403 Forbidden** - Origin/referer not allowed (serves `403.html`)
- **404 Not Found** - Route not found (serves `404.html`)
- **400 Bad Request** - Invalid request parameters
- **429 Too Many Requests** - Rate limit exceeded
- **500 Internal Server Error** - Server error
